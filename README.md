High school project, Asteroids-esque game with level and score system.

During the last few weeks of my high school's AP class, students are encouarged to take up a personal project and are graded for completing, or trying to complete, whatever they decided upon. I went with an asteroids game because when I was first learning object oriented programming a year prior, an asteroids game was one of the first examples shown to me, and it was the first thing that came to mind

Instructions:

Use Left and Right arrow keys to change heading, and Up arrow key to accelerate. Space to shoot asteroids. Score increases constantly as you survive, but player recieves large bumps in score if they destroy asteroids. The level ends when the timer runs out, every level has five more asteroids at the start that the last level
